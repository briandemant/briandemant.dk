This is a simple but deceivingly powerful Sinatra blog.  It's a great way to learn Sinatra and gives full control of your website code.

The code for this Sinatra blog originated from Hugh Evans but has been modified to fit my needs. You can find the original repo here "hughevans.net":http://github.com/artpop/hughevans.net/tree/master.
